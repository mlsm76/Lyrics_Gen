A garden grew between us
In the love we lived without
Remaining faithful to the flood
Our tears have purpose in a drought
Tread lightly, so footprints can't disturb the bed we've made
With restlessness reserved for both the bodies it contains


Aim your sharpest arrow at the center of my chest
A memorial to signify the sense of helplessness
We dare not mourn our past lives
Our loss will be reborn
Because I couldn't love who you were
But you're not you anymore


Sew your skeleton to mine
I'm no good on my own
Stitch yourself to either side of me so I will never be alone
We mend our past mistakes
As a symbol that we've grown
So we no longer place our weight on top of broken bones


Mark an end to aimless roaming
With a double-sided knife
If we develop eyes for others
May we both be stripped of sight
Liken our divide to partitions in the earth
Wrapped in walls of vines
Growing out of common ground
A garden grew between us
Our tears have purpose in a drought


Sew your skeleton to mine
I'm no good on my own
Stitch yourself to either side of me so I will never be alone
We mend our past mistakes
As a symbol that we've grown
So we no longer place our weight
On top of broken bones


Mark an end to aimless roaming
With a double-sided knife
Taking steps towards each other
We could end both our lives
(And that'd be fine)


Aim your sharpest arrow at the center of my chest
A memorial to signify the sense of helplessness
We dare not mourn our past lives
Though our loss will be reborn
I couldn't love who you were
But you're not you anymore We shiver in the pause between words
Abandonment still fresh upon the tips of our tongues
The whispers we’ve chosen to live and die in will infect deaf ears with the discordance of deceit
Why do we scream when there is nothing left to say?
Silently acknowledging the solace in loss
I am content with throwing everything away because I lost myself when I found you

Carry me back to your bed
My conscience is my coffin and I swear sometimes I’d rather be dead
Make sure that I still feel, I don’t care how much it hurts
I’ll always be numb on my side of the earth

In the dark I watched the light hit your skin, hoping that my eyes might never adjust
Soft sounds save me from the confines of sleep because hearing your voice once was never enough
I think I’ve finally identified the Difference
I think I live in both my hell and my home
I will forever be a slave to your distance
Don’t let me in
Don’t let me go

Carry me back to your bed
My conscience is my coffin and I swear sometimes I’d rather be dead
Make sure that I still feel, I don’t care how much it hurts
I’ll always be numb on my side of the earth
Don’t let me in, don’t let me go

(In this moment)
I’d rather die than live without you
I’d rather die 
Disconnecting veins in an effort to release my tragedy
All that we leave behind is misery
And my disease is a sanctuary
A curse that unfolds like a novel
But I’d sooner slit my wrists with the first page


I find it hard to feel alive
While my heart beats in borrowed time
The cadence that I’ve kept confined
Existing only in the black behind my eyes
Not worthy of a memory
Deny all grief and force yourself to forget me
Don’t allow my ghost to linger any longer than it has
Let my spirit breathe, I’ve finally found peace


Allow me to exist only in the empty spaces between breaths
In the margin of each exhale that you’re sure that you have left
Be mindful of the way speaking my name could leave a poison on your lips
And the ache that binds your bones will be my parting gift
A grave unfit to bear the blame
Pale limbs like flowers to be tied in a bouquet
That the soil refused to cultivate
To be born, to live, to die, rotting away

There’s nothing to be done
I can’t be saved


I find it hard to feel alive
While my heart beats in borrowed time
The cadence that I’ve kept confined
Existing only in the black behind my eyes
Not worthy of a memory
Deny all grief and force yourself to forget me
Don’t allow my ghost to linger any longer than it has
Let my spirit breathe, I’ve finally found peace Back-pedaling into the black
But I can still make out the figures
That will threaten my well-being
The wind will rise and fall
But never sway from side to side

Progression halted
Encapsulating the fluid weave of death
Like a garden that contains all of its arrested offspring
We’re afraid to force our legs to break free from the earth
And take the first step towards our insecurity

Sleep away your selfishness
Slip into collapse
A still-like state of disregard
From which you can’t fall back
You never fully moved me
I’ve been embedded in the dust
And my mind has been ravaged by war

Pray for farewell as if I was yours to lose
I would love to love you, if you were someone else
So forgive me for being unresponsive
I’m sure it’s hard to train your ears
To hear me crying out for help
With my lips sewn shut by the stitches of my own indecision

So I’ll speak in whispers to permit my throat relief
I bite my tongue
Fill my mouth with blood
And swallow enough to kill me
Before I’m forced to lose more sleep
So I’ll speak in whispers to permit my throat relief
I bite my tongue
Fill my mouth with blood
And swallow enough to kill me

I would love to love you
If you were someone else
Am I fit to walk alone again
Or will you save me from myself?
Breathe life into me
Be all that I can see
Or carry on without me
And just know I wished you well I’ve grown accustomed to losing sleep
Sweep me off my feet
Dig your nails into my wounds and pull
A lucid dream
Where my chest will collapse from the weight of a fictitious ghost
Tear through me, sacrifice me to your sea
With broken arms I’m left to carry my shell
With no help from the current

Lifeless, I am dragging me down
Hollow, I’m left to fend for myself

Forget everything that you’ve come to know
We are not meant for much but to carry our own misery
Is there a God cursing every step that I take?
Or have I been forced to commit myself to the dirt?
We’re chasing the light in the darkest of graves
But the fortunate ones know to wait until mourning

Be still
Serenity blesses us in waves
And with eyes like mountains, we’re drawn to the brow
Leave this life behind and take the next step in the right direction Stare at the sky, and offer yourself to circumstance
Be the burn
Burn me alive
Be the burn
Burn me alive Your ghost holds me close
As I’m ravaged by the solitary that surrounds my former home
Use me until you’ve spent the rest of my remains
And then try to validate your actions
Cursing every empty vein
That used to be inhabited by your impression

Paralyze me
To ensure I have no chance of knowing the feeling of affection
It’s no secret that I’ve shed the common decency
That appoints the world with the burden of devotion to our kin
I gave you everything I had and the world has left me exhausted

(So make me feel)
So make me feel something
Anything that might change my mind
As worthless as I am, I know that I still serve a purpose
To leech off the light and absolve my insignificance

Lay me to rest
Lay me to rest inside of a glass casket
So you can remember me with a smile on my face
Adorning me in my own failures
So you can count them as you stand above my bones

I wish I were a better man
I am a coward masked in courage
And just admitting this will not save me this time
So free me from my tired mind
And let me learn the difference
Between a single tear and the runoff of an ocean
Weak and weary from my predatory nature
So bless me with abandonment in my greatest time of need

Let me carry on knowing that I could never truly face my reflection
It’s much easier to caress the broken glass (broken glass)
Though if I accidentally catch a glimpse of myself in the shards
I will put my faith in the shrapnel to correct my vision

I am a stranger when I stare into the eyes of those I love
Look away in disgust
Protect yourself from the sight of my deception
I am a stranger when I stare into the eyes of those I love
Look away in disgust
Protect yourself from the sight of my deception Congregate what little ounce of decency is left
And gather enough courage to invoke contractions in your vocal chords
Admission of guilt through confrontation
I’ve had to chisel every lie out of your mouth
And after all this time I’ve grown immune to your embrace
Spare me and my virgin ears from a stale conception
Admit that I’m the victim and cradle consequence
Line your insides with a sense of wrongly obtained righteousness
Spread your poison as thin as you possibly can
To ensure you violate every inch of common ground

Call me a cancer
Keep convinced that you’re not sick yourself
You will be exposed as soon as the world's eyes can fully adjust to the dark
I was the cure to your corrosion
But now I want to watch your skin rust and slowly grow discoloured
And when your throat buckles under the weight of the accumulation of perjury
I want to watch the life seep out of your tear duct
As your death rattle hits my eardrum and thaws what’s left of my cold heart

I hope you choke to death
The compass has been cracked
I hope you fucking choke to death Take comfort in the cadence of the bond we share
A visionary born and raised to see with an unbiased sense of sight
We pause just for a second to properly embrace the radiance
We are the anointed dipped in filth
Taught to cower in fear of being identified
But tragedy will find us

And I’m held captive by my spoiled soul
I won’t allow it to affect my stride
The procession will proceed
As we’re gifted with our own idea of peace

So find yourself in me
I promise I will keep you as we harvest the passion that remains
Make my skin your sanctuary

I make a pact with the earth to draw life from the living
Make my skin your sanctuary
Leap to the beat of my blood
So place your hand in mine, drag your feet across the tops of trees
Breathe easy knowing that the branches will support you
And the weight of your complication

In the midst of the ruin that surrounds us
We communicate but only in tongues
Our lips will welcome the caress of crucifixion
And we stain the wood with defeat

I am not a mortal, I am a metaphor for moving forward 
I long to run hand in hand with angels
To feel the grace of shattered glass against my wrist
Did the mother of God cry for her son?
Will mine suffer the same before I'm gone?
The last thing I will see is my own face
As I float between two worlds


I long to run hand in hand with angels
To feel the grace of shattered glass against my wrist
Don't weep for me
I will shine brighter from above
To feel the need for the first time as I leave


Did the mother of God cry for her son
Even though she knew this day would come?
Before I'm gone, the stations of the cross
Serve as reminders of the closest things we've lost
(Nothing left to love)
Will you love me when there's nothing left to love?
(Nothing left to love)
Will you love me when there's nothing left to love?
(Nothing left to love)
Will you love me when there's nothing left to love?
(Nothing left to love)
Will you love me when there's nothing left to love?
(Nothing left to love)
Love me when there's nothing left to love
(Nothing left to love)
Love me when there's nothing left to love
(Nothing left to love)
Love me when there's nothing left to love
(Nothing left to love)


Nothing left to love
Nothing left to love
Nothing left to love
Nothing left to love
Nothing left to love
Nothing left to love
Nothing left to love 
I'm clinging to the wings of nightmares
Detaching every finger one by one
Shaken awake
To find our absence hasn't manifested yet
Longing for a sense of loss
Picking me apart like birds of prey
Where illusions will depart from unhinged jaws
Silent in the presence of your name
Rip the memory from my mind
Perfectly still, but somehow running out of time


Keep your distance
From the flowers that will decorate my corpse
Undeserving of a chance to watch them thrive
Remove the sickness
Before it has a chance to run its course
I knew we'd never make it out alive


Clairvoyant only to delusion
As you salvage fantasy to fit your needs
You held my lifeless body to your heart
And convinced yourself that you could feel a pulse


(Laying traps beneath my feet
I will chew through to the bone in my desire to be free)
Rip the memory from my mind
Perfectly still, but somehow running out of time


Keep your distance
From the flowers that will decorate my corpse
Undeserving of a chance to watch them thrive
Remove the sickness
Before it has a chance to run its course
I knew we'd never make it out alive


Your shadow will keep me
Blinded by the light living in lies
Allowing fallen petals to turn black
Reflecting the colour of your insides


Rip the memory from my mind
Hold my lifeless body to your heart
And convince yourself that you still feel a pulse
Rip the memory from my mind
Perfectly still, but somehow running out of time 
How comforting it feels to breathe with hands around my neck
Sleepwalk your way around my arteries if you're restless
Dig through me
(Dig through me)
Swim beneath my skin
In the precipitation I've graciously gathered


I won't let you drown inside me
I won't let you drown inside me


Useless blood will fade
Like a dark cloud that has purged itself of rain
Humanity will bathe in our transparency
Positioned over trenches
We allow our wounds to drain
Searching for a virgin conduit in vain


How comforting it feels to breathe
With your knees upon my chest
When consciousness disguises itself as paralysis
Dig through me
(Dig through me)
Swim beneath my skin
In the precipitation I've graciously gathered


I won't let you drown inside me
I won't let you drown inside me


Positioned over trenches so we can purge ourselves of rain
Falling from our wounds through empty arteries


You are the blood that my heart bleeds
You are the blood that my heart bleeds


Positioned over trenches
So we can purge ourselves of rain
Falling from our wounds

You are the blood my heart bleeds 
In you no passion bleeds
A shell that's thin and withering
Did you misplace your flame
In pursuit of a new hell to help you heal or burn the same?
Dedication makes a martyr out of me
While you're afraid to offer flakes of skin
Your fire dies, dependent on the embers I provide
Shield your blaze from beads of sweat


No servant
No servant of mine
Turn your back and flee
Bending over backwards to be sure we watched you leave
No servant of mine
Turn your back and flee
You are not owed more than the shoulders you have burdened


Contentment breeds in our disintegration
Like bitter pills digested by the sick
I wish you luck and hope you've found your medicine
(Pray that it kills you quick)
The chase has clouded your perception
Beg to be buried in the sky
Dependent on the embers I provide, your fire dies
The same mud buries both of us alive
And still you search for different shades of dirt


No servant
No servant of mine
Turn your back and flee
Bending over backwards to be sure we watched you leave
No servant of mine
Turn your back and flee
You are not owed more than the shoulders you have burdened 
All of our lives we’ve been told what to believe
“Nothing is perfect” so what’s the point of purpose?
The line that separates the weak from us who truly care
Is one I don’t intend to cross
The heart of man beats but only in greedy hands
And it seems that most are still content
Where most are comfortable accepting insignificance
We strive to find the effort within


You open up your eyes, and open up your mind
You will be exposed, to a world as cold
As those who are left to populate it
Two decades spent swallowing lie, after lie
Has sparked a fire in my heart
And the time has come to spread the flame


We can’t continue wasting time
Day after day trying to find a new means of escape
We can’t continue wasting time
Day after day


I do it day after day
I do it day after fucking day
And I can’t face the disconnect
I’ll shed the dead weight and rise
And I can’t face the disconnect
I’ll shed the dead weight and rise


I never thought, that I would need to justify a reason
To continue on in this life I lead
I fucking hate the world
I fucking hate myself
I swore I'd never fucking feel like this


And I hate the world
And I hate myself
I hate the world I am a desperate attempt at putting my exhaustion into words
Cut my tongue out of my mouth
It's about as useless as my lungs

I have nothing left in me to give
I am a monument for those who live and breathe in empty space

Put a fucking bullet in my head
And dig your feet into my back before you leave
Murder me and my intentions or bury me alive
Fill my lungs with dirt and watch the light drain from my eyes

Fold me in half like the blank pages that will taunt me to my face
Words like razors aimed directly at my wrists and now I speak

I have nothing left in me to give
Words like razors aimed directly at my wrists and now I speak
I have nothing left in me to give
Tie my lies around my throat until I finally tell the truth
I have nothing left in me to give
Words like razors aimed directly at my wrists and now I speak
I have nothing left in me to give
This is my eulogy, don't pretend to miss me when I'm gone Compare our dependence to predator and prey
A parallel engraved into our souls by the work of broken hands
(Contradiction carved in canvas)
(And our nail-beds ache from scratching at the surface)

Coerced by your creation
Finding foundation in decay
With the culmination of our failure on display
Convince yourself I am your greatest masterpiece

Disassemble me however you see fit
And put me back together absolving me of my impurities
And you know I'd welcome your embrace
Even if your arms resembled teeth

Cover me in scars
Close your eyes in case I bleed
I'd let you cover me in scars if you could carry me forever

Carry me forever in your heart
Carry me forever in your heart
Carry me forever in your heart

A predator, a prey
Release me from the mouth of dependency
Forgive me for my absence
Our love will know not wasted time Portraits of hope reflecting of a blade that bears my name
Hanging inches from my head
There is no light bright enough to bring my shadow back to life
A presence that the fortunate weren't predisposed to feel
My seance of surrender will fall upon deaf ears

Promises I have disowned appear before me
Resembling the outline of my soul
Unravel me, every sentence makes me sick
Bound and abandoned by a noose that lifts me off my feet
Hanging like a halo overhead, I knew your rope was made for me

Fading, I fall backwards into the dust
Positioned vertically, but a casket knows to catch me
Buried only waist-deep in the earth
We carve the fading features of our silhouettes into our coffin doors

Hope is a blade that bears my name
I knew your rope was made for me A calm rushes over me
As I picture my corpse, ill-fated with the faults I can’t escape
A sigh of relief, a sigh of relief used to signify the blight
That infects the last few fragments of my skull

Sometimes I swear I think that I’ll be fine
I’ve made up my mind, death is my birthright
I am a noose waiting to be tied
Still I try to elude the truth and embrace my disguise
Because this way of life takes its toll on mine
And I don’t want to be alive

Bury me breathing so I can watch myself decay
Bury me breathing so I can watch myself decay
So I can watch myself decay

We are stillborns by definition
But our pulse-infected wrists will disagree
We burden ourselves with intent and ambition
When we’ve accepted that all hope is lost
So dance past my lips and disperse
Leaving no trace of human condition
Our bodies blind the world with a sense of selflessness
That only a trained eye can see

You blame me for your blindness
Open your eyes
You blame me for your blindness
Open your eyes I’m shaking and so are my hands
And I can’t tell if it’s the cold or if I’m finally feeling regret
A martyr in my own mind and a pariah
Given the capacity of my own guilt

Do I fight the fact that I am a nervous wreck
Or do I face the forthcoming collision head on?
I don’t know how to abandon my blind heart
(And I’m convinced that you deserve this)

My organs are dark and minuscule
In comparison to yours
I’m no longer pining to cure my disease
I’m just dying to advance the process

Trim your wings and deceive me
Cinch your halo around my neck
Because death houses such beauty
If we can enjoy what will grow in its absence
We are thin and wasted at both ends
And we’ve accepted our position

I was never worthy of following your footsteps
So be sure to leave no evidence that you’ve existed
We dare not turn and face the figures treating us to our descent
If we knew their origin then we’d surely be disgusted

This is the kind of illness
That leaves us rotting from the inside out
And we wear this on our sleeves
Content with our casualty
I would do this all over again
I’m the catalyst of our collapse
Haunted by conviction
And a partner to the pain

Forgive me for who I’ve become these past few years
Forgive me for allowing my love to disappear

Trim your wings and deceive me
Cinch your halo around my neck
And just leave me alone with my thoughts
Eaten alive until there’s nothing left to mourn
I will resonate through the minds of others
As a corpse and nothing more, nothing more 
Not what you need
Not what you need
We've been seduced by suffering
In spite of separation

Embedded in my head
The hallucination settles

If our memories don't drag their feet in dirt
Their steps can't be retraced
So we spin until we're sick
Longing for the loss of balance
A fall that carries us from heaven to our grave


You haunt me
You haunt me like an empty home
Priceless possession
I bring you with me wherever I go
Wander through me
Rearranging my insides in search of sleep
So well rested
You forget to bring me with you when you leave


Punish my body for the things my soul has seen
I've been staring into sunlight counting backwards
While the radiance blinds me
Flawed reflections will make themselves at home
Convincing us to walk barefoot through miles of broken mirrors


You haunt me
You haunt me like an empty home
Priceless possession
I bring you with me wherever I go
Wander through me
Rearranging my insides in search of sleep
So well rested
You forget to bring me with you when you leave


Hollow out my body
I know you need somewhere to sleep
Change the locks on doors I've left open inside of me
Hollow out my body
I'm not what you need
(Not what you need)
In spite of separation
We've been seduced by suffering


You haunt me
Like an empty home
You haunt me


Migrate as you may
Swallowing your spare key for safekeeping
Wander where you please
Inside of me
You haunt me 
Warn only those who choose to hear
A disappearing trail of death
So spare me your sentiments and accept me as I am
Salvation reaches out through familiar screams
Begging me to stay
Reserve your mourning for the dead
Who wish they had but one day left
No need to waste your grief on me
I'm with you now


Will the ones I love
Forgive me for leaving too soon?
Caught in the space between paradise and plague
There’s nowhere I'd rather be than with you


Warn only those who choose to hear
A disappearing trail of death
Abandon the hope you had and accept me as I am


No one could save me
I was born inside my grave


No one could save me
I was born inside my grave


Reserve your mourning for the dead
Who wish they had but one day left
No need to waste your grief on me
I'm with you now


(Will the ones I love)
Forgive me for leaving too soon?
Caught in the space between paradise and plague
There’s nowhere I'd rather be than with you
There's nowhere I'd rather be than with you
There's nowhere I'd rather be than with you There are no rewards for consuming the wounded
Starved for an easy kill, keep your hunger at bay
I will use your flesh to keep her warm

God would break character if he could for a chance to spit in your face
Guardian angels couldn't keep you safe from me

With my last breath, I will strangle you to death with your own fucking hands

I will make my peace removing the arms of unrepentant thieves Don't adorn me like the dead
I deserve to look like myself once again
Suspended from the sky like ornaments
Nothing to no one, only memories misread

I am a farewell that even heaven won't accept
Collecting scars like souvenirs of pasts we can't forget
Broken glass, swept over the bodies I know best
I am a farewell that even heaven won't accept

Separate me from a finished product like needle and thread
Translating words to portray the vacant pages they live in

A requiem worshipped for the pauses it contains
Praising not the essence but the meaningless remain

Collecting shards from mirror images of me
I am no idol
I am no idol for the weak
Nothing to no one, a memory misread
Collecting shards from mirror images of me
I am no idol for the weak

I am a farewell
I am a farewell that even heaven won't accept

I am a farewell that even heaven won't accept
Collecting scars like souvenirs of pasts we can't forget
Broken glass, swept over the bodies I know best
I am a farewell that even heaven won't accept The weight came and went and took my will to live
Spoiled by defeat, forced to drown in what's left of me
That's when breathing became routine
And I could feel myself fading

No direction, I am a compass
Constantly spinning
Constantly searching for the end
Never reaching our destination
But the goal was never when
Or where
Or who...
It was only you

I appeared in your arms as if I had been born there
You promised you'd never let me go
But I don't know what I believe anymore
Affection allowed me to let the light in
The fear made me whole again
Help me rebuild my broken bones
Help me regain my sanity
But with caution always present
Our pasts manifest themselves
And we act as if this is what we deserve
But I refuse to fail again

I'd force my ghost to write your name in the flowers on my grave
I watched the world give up on me

I used to spend my nights praying for air in my bloodstream
Now I long to feel your breath pass throughout my arteries
The goal was never when
Or where
Or who...
It was only you

I appeared in your arms as if I had been born there
You promised you'd never let me go
But I don't know what I believe anymore
Fill me with your faith and let me leave

I'm scratching at my skin to take my mind
Off the absence we've created
The lines blur together like the veins in my arms
And I wish I wasn't so alone
You are the difference between hell and home Your words grew cold and incoherent and I’m
Searching for a fever that could
Lift me to the border of dementia
My eyes are tired from surveying everything we used to share
And I would sew them shut if I had any strength inside
I remember every promise, I’ve carved them into my spine

I raise my hands to the sky
And beg that this won’t go unnoticed
Though I know some fires are not meant to burn

We are bred to flicker and fade
Not to retreat into the earth, not to grow without remorse
We douse ourselves with the moisture
That we’ve drawn from the soil
We breed and unleash, we’re our own natural disaster
String me along like the thread that binds your ribcage
Tie my limbs to the anchor, and be sure that I’m
Left alone to sink

I will shine brighter than the sun
I will forever be your torch
Cast me away
And in time I will set fire to the fibers that connect us

My palms grow calloused from the cold
I need your touch to cauterize
Sustained by the flame of another
The embers begin to reignite

There’s a hole in the herd that will never be filled
The anguish will fall through your fingers
As mankind manifests itself through misfortune
I am alone and the world carries on
I am alone, the world carries on
And we don’t deserve a second thought Immerse yourself in the water that flows freely from my hands
You’ll find no substance, just the rain that we use to simply bathe and disregard
I bless my arteries with blades, and I welcome the sight of the back of my eyelids
In our most peaceful and remote state, we’re allowed to choose what we want to feel
Mortality is the greatest gift given to the living, but a curse to those who feel that they’re truly alive

Sentenced to trespass, I should spin towards the north… but your gravity has left me alone and I’m left to roam as an apparition
Abandoned, I am a phantom limb in search of a frame to spread my plague
If the light leaves you blind, just shut your eyes and embrace the undertow
Let the waves puncture your lungs
In my dreams we drown together
Everything goes black but I can see you just fine

Condolences flourish and fall upon my feet and help pollinate the dirt that sits in the pit of your stomach
I need to shed the idea of a lasting impression

Make peace with my spirit breach

Everything goes black and I still see you in my dreams
Lower your head to sleep and let me do the same
I’m confident that we will meet again, every time you wade in a body of water
I am the light that leaves you blind, but I watched you retreat and cover your eyes
In your rivers I reside
In dreams we drown together
Everything goes black but you will see me just fine 
Numbing the nerve endings in my arms to endure a vain embrace
Exhausted by the light leaving our eyes
Our leap of faith will lead us to a bed of blades
Remove the skin and reveal to me the likeness of a ghost
As teardrops find their way towards my throat
Our leap of faith will lead us to a bed of blades
Descending from the heaven we created in our heads


We both bleed (We both bleed)
But out of separate wounds
Not meant to mend a different breed of broken
Pulling the cure out of the suffering themselves
We are two different breeds of broken


Remove the skin and reveal to me the likeness of a ghost
As teardrops find their way towards my throat
I'd sooner die with the deserted than coexist amidst feigned love
Bringing your hands towards the sky, expecting me to cast myself down


We are two different breeds of broken
Our leap of faith will lead us to a bed of blades
Descending from the heaven we created in our heads


We both bleed, but out of separate wounds
Not meant to mend a different breed of broken
Pulling the cure out of the suffering themselves
We are two different breeds of broken
We are two different breeds of broken I bask in familiar flesh with no shelter to call my own
A sacrifice for my sickness, I’ll dig a grave for those I love
I release the teeth from my jaw
Knowing that I will miss the pain when you take shelter in the mouth of another
You live in the back of my throat
Spawning sentences in unison with mine

Stay safe in my breath, you will never be lost
If our attraction is only skin deep, how deep is deep enough?

I’ve made a habit out of grinding my bones into a sharper point when I hear your name...
And I’ve named each cut you’ve cursed me with
Though I wish I had the courage to ask for more
Your spirit suffocates me
You won’t find asylum inside
I never asked for your blood in my veins
So haunt me not and disappear
I am a victim, despite what you’ve heard
Forced to dwell inside of endless withdrawal
We can never coexist, so I will offer up my heart
Don’t look back and try to find me
I was always doomed to watch you from the dark

Stay safe in my breath, you will never be lost
If our attraction is only skin deep, how deep is deep enough? 
Hold my eyelids open and secure my hanging head
Digging shards of bone from both our feet
Removing teeth to free what's left of sentences unsaid
Ensuring my last breath echoes relief
We ignore the sound of two dissolving souls
As our home disintegrates into a grave
Rebuilt above burnt earth to be sure nothing else can grow


You left as I was dreaming
But when I opened my eyes you swore you were still here
Preserving footprints in the colour of our blood
And as our veins ran dry you swore you were still here


Suffocate me in my sleep
The weight of my belief will bury me
Suffocate me in my sleep
The weight of my belief will bury me


I felt your presence fleeing long before you took your leave
You swore you were still here
Leaving small incisions in the hands that used to hold me
(And as our veins ran dry you swore you were still here)


Hold my eyelids open and secure my hanging head
Digging shards of bone from both our feet
Removing teeth to free what's left of sentences unsaid
Ensuring my last breath echoes relief
We ignore the sound of two dissolving souls
As our home disintegrates into a grave
Rebuilt above burnt earth to be sure nothing else can grow


You swore you were still here
You swore you were still here 
I am the dagger
I will drive into my heart
To drain myself of my impurity


Abandoned at conception
Feeding off affection left behind
I'll never know acceptance
If people only come to me to die


All I've cherished will run from my embrace
Nothing will stay
Nothing will stay
Dwell in my debris
Never knowing how it feels to be at peace
(Nothing will stay)


A confidence I could never conceive
When the weight of insecurity becomes too much to bear
Perception will deceive me
Losing sight as I stare into a razor
To be rewarded collections of my flaws


I am the dagger I will drive into my heart
I am the dagger I will drive into my heart
To drain myself of my impurity
I am the blade forced into my face
Rearranging features for the pleasure of perfection


Losing sight as I stare into a razor
To be rewarded collections of my flaws


All I've cherished will run from my embrace
Nothing will stay
Nothing will stay
Dwell in my debris
Never knowing how it feels to be at peace
Nothing will stay
Nothing will stay
All I've cherished will run from my embrace
Nothing will stay
Nothing will stay 
Tear the tears out of my open eyes
For I no longer need to drown in the ocean of another
Tear the tears out of my open eyes
Above a buried garden we've both lived in
And bring me back to life


I promised I’d be devoid of devotion
Until a blinding light could thaw me from my core
Shining between the lips of lacerations
As we compare the way that we burn to the sun


Throw yourself into the middle of my arms
And I swear I'll keep you safe
The scars that you keep secret were placed upon my limbs
And I would fill them in with my flesh if I could
I swear I'll keep you safe


Tear the tears out of my open eyes
For I no longer need to drown in the ocean of another
Tear the tears out of my open eyes
Above a buried garden we’ve both lived in
And bring me back to life


Pull the nameless arrow from my chest
And exchange it with your own
Replace the hurt within me with a stare that watches over me
When I allow myself to sleep


The scars that you keep secret were placed upon my limbs
And I would fill them in with my flesh if I could


(So throw yourself into the middle of my arms
And I swear I'll keep you safe)


Tear the tears out of my open eyes
For I no longer need to drown in the ocean of another
Tear the tears out of my open eyes
Above a buried garden we've both lived in
To bring me back to life 
Will you love me when there's nothing left to love?
Will you love me when there's nothing left to love?


Will you love me when there's nothing left to love?
Will you love me when there's nothing left to love?


There's nothing left to love
There's nothing left to love
There's nothing left to love
There's nothing left to love 
Resurface from contaminated soil when you're starved
As the poison thins your blood, drown in your dependence
Writing a false doctrine in which you portray a victim
While we both know I'm the reason you were spared
I should've let you die
And I live with the regret of my decision
I should've let you die
And the day will come when I will be the reason you repent


You threw yourself onto your own knife
(Should've let you die)


No man but me can disfigure my creation
I will absolve you of your sins and hurl you into hell myself


Your senses can no longer recognize my saving grace
As the poison thins your blood, drown in your dependence
Silently securing your neck within my noose
To mirror your vicious transgressions


No man but me can disfigure my creation
I will absolve you of your sins and hurl you into hell myself


I should've let you die
I should've let you die
I should've let you die
(I should've let you die) Bred to feel an unfamiliar touch
Lust begins and ends with both of us
Keep me close, drag me down
In the wake of shallow waves you leave
Fill the void like fingers in my mouth
Spread slowly like a plague I’ve invited into me
Emotions cast like stones skipped across empty lakes
And selfishly I sink

Absence of affection, not worth the cancer I have caused
Sever the ties to keep from stringing this along
Keep me close, suspended just out of arms reach
No vacant pair of wings were ever fit to hold me
Keep me close in the wake of shallow waves you leave
The water left me filthy but somehow you’re completely clean

Cure your rust from within
No desire lives past dawn…nocturnal by default
Speak softly, drive a nail through both of my lips if you must
We whisper as a metaphor for trust
Selfishly I sink Dissolving in small oceans
Responsible for concentrating currents
To match a pulse in us that no longer exists
Resurfacing only when we're running out of air

Apprehensive from our absent-heartedness
Spitting blood from confidence confessed
Inducing dreams in which we never met to rid myself of regret
We were a pair of fragile limbs
Too weak to carry us to bed
Stretched so thin but somehow burning at both ends

Foreshadowing the pain of transferring dead weight
While we can barely stay awake
A self inflicted severance will seal our fate

Let it die, we had to let this die

Apprehensive from our absent-heartedness
Spitting blood from confidence confessed
We were a pair of fragile limbs
Too weak to carry us to bed
Stretched so thin but somehow burning at both ends

Dissolving in small oceans like the salt into our wounds
To match the pulse in us that no longer exists
We were a pair of fragile limbs
Too weak to carry us to bed
Stretched so thin but somehow burning at both ends 
Hands of hesitation intersect and leave me dead
Sharpening their edges inches from my neck
Inhaling the uncertainty that hangs above my head
With portraits of my death carved into my chest


Running without feeling in our legs
We don't appreciate the cuts that we've collected
Drifting through a swarm of thorns
As our agony reminds us these scars were self-inflicted


I'll give you every second till I'm gone
I hate it here and never want to leave


I hoped this flame would burn forever
I'll give you every second till I'm gone (Till I'm gone)
Staring in the face of my own fate
I hate it here and never want to leave (And never want to leave)


The imprints I have left will surely fade
But the memories remind us we shared the same pain


I'll give you every second till I'm gone
I hate it here and never want to leave


I hoped this flame would burn forever
I'll give you every second till I'm gone (Till I'm gone)
Staring in the face of my own fate
I hate it here and never want to leave


I will incinerate myself in my own circle of hell
A blind world won't read my lips
Though it might hear my faint farewell
I will incinerate myself in my own circle of hell
A blind world won't read my lips
Though it might hear my faint farewell


All living things will starve cradled in complacency
Content inside the coffin I've created
I hate it here and never want to leave Expose me for all that I am
The man behind the masquerade
I am my own false witness

Fact resides solely in the depths of my mind
And will I ever really let it come to surface?
You only see what I want you to see
And you believe all that you're told

Serenity is a beautiful hoax, a liar
I have the whole world convinced of my contentment
No truth in this
I've lost count of all the times I've made it home alive...
And wished I hadn't

Expose me for all that I am
The man behind the masquerade
I am my own false witness
I'm left to conquer the mountains in my mind
And I am my maker

Life is what's killing me
I hate the fact that I'm just fine
Forever seeking anything to take responsibility
Life is what's killing me
I hate the fact that I'm alive
Forever searching for my scapegoat because
I refuse to face reality

At least I can say I tried to cherish
Every single day when I woke up and didn't want to die
I'd work my hands to the bone
Trying to stay suspended in those specific seconds
But I know I'm just counting down the minutes
Until I'm miserable again I’ve never told this to anyone
I’m just trying to move past
But lately it seems that my insecurities got the best of me
And I’m no longer in control
No one should ever have to feel like this
To feel like me
And even though the good I have outweighs the bad
The bad's what’s leaving me with sleepless nights

I spend most of my time arguing with my own reflection
For no apparent reason
And it may seem as if I have all the answers
But I’m just as lost as you
I’ve spend the past few years trying to overcome my own misery, but these sort of things take time, and I’m running out of mine
I'm running out of mine

So I will pray to a God that isn’t there
To a world that doesn’t hear
To anyone who will listen
To keep me from becoming everything I promised myself that I would never be
I do not deserve this Everything ends
At least that's what we hope for
Plagued by our past
And we're doomed to repeat ourselves

Afraid of the thoughts that dance in revolutions
And circle the mind like a snare
Binding me
I'm just trying to feel something

Cold and stale
Searching for warmth inside of every promise wasted
You wrap yourself around me
But I can only sense your presence
You're nothing but a carcass

I've never felt more alone than I did on those nights
I spent watching you sleep
You're the furthest thing from me
And you've been there from the start

An empty shell
You're vacant and it scares me to death
One by one
I watched them leave me behind like living debris
Fortunately, I know that I'm not worth it
In my purest form, I was never good enough for anyone
Why did I think that this time it'd be different?

I came bearing only the beat of my heart
And the best of my intentions

I tried my hardest but I couldn't make you feel a fucking thing Born of two; raised by four
I guess I took it all for granted
And only three remain

Even though you're wounded
I know that you're still here
I don't blame you
You just can't face the change

We spend our golden years as living ghosts
Caught in a constant state of purgatory
We are only burdened by our memories
Until the day they cease to exist
And we follow shortly after

Although I wonder if at any time
Our minds fell upon the same plane
I know they did
I just wish I had a chance to go back and appreciate it
But we'll always have the winter
And the snow that got you trapped behind the glass
You may be only a shell of the man that you used to be
But I love you just the same
And I will until the day you're gone

I just never know if I'm communicating with you or the disease
And even though I curse the idea of an afterlife
I still hope you're taken care of
You deserve to be at peace
Please don't forget my face
I won't forget to remember you We carry our devotion parting silence like a sea from the air into our lungs
Aim to be outspoken, awaiting gusts of wind strong enough to shake the words from our tongues

We are not known for easing tension
We'd rather tilt our heads and swallow teeth

Shelter me from dreams in which you die
I'd rather witness my own death
Eyelids open like I never needed rest
I hope I choke from no practice speaking my own sentences
Moving forward from my former self
I haven't missed me yet

We are not known for our forgiveness
Only the acts that we forgive

I would much prefer our fate resting in the palms of open hands rather than confined in a clenched fist

We carry our devotion with our guilt like thorn and stem resembling an orchid recently resurrected

We have lived and died both in earth and by your bedside
Preserved in soil, we confide in connection

We are not known for our forgiveness
Only the acts that we forgive
We are not known for our forgiveness
Letting go so we may live
Shelter me from dreams in which you die
I'd rather witness my own death
We are not known for our forgiveness
But regardless, we forgive I live with the awareness of my own seclusion
Existence fueled by separation
A war I will not win
Embracing only alienation
To suffer is to abandon the only home I've ever had

Outlier
I don't belong here
The present state of existence acts as a refuge for the weak
To shield our eyes is to blind mankind
Refusal to secede
Inhabiting a world of filth which others have condemned
We won't live our lives for them

Human hatred is my second nature
This is the root of my isolation
I am what I am
And I am an outcast

Don't look for me in the clouds
When I am beneath you nowhere to be found
Submerged in apathy
It's just becoming hard to care
And I am nothing

I have grown sick of the sound of my heartbeat
And while the whole world breathes in unison
My lungs are my shield
To reject the world around me

I am what I am
And I am an outcast
I am what I am
And I am an outcast
This is the root of my isolation
And I'm starting to lose all control
And I am an outcast  Every fucking day
I have to deal with the pressure I put on myself, to outdo myself
But I can’t ask for help
I can’t admit I’m weak
I’m going back on my words, I’m going back on who I used to be
Every day I wage a war on myself because I’d rather die than let this win over me
I can’t let this win over me
How can I be expected to help anyone else
When I can’t even help myself?
Call me a hypocrite and I’ll be the first one to agree
I am no longer the prophet that I once claimed to be
I’m stuck between trying to find where I stand, and what it is I stand for
I am no one The grave welcomes you with open arms
Last light escapes, last breath remains
Circling the body
Brushing past the skin and bone
It cradles you, your holy manger

Born into ruin, we feel withdraw
Death is your procreator, your predecessor
From your decay grows a beautiful garden
The stalks caress your failure
And the petals bring you closer to eternity

Pray for your rebirth
Pray for your chance to bloom
The heart starts and stops
The mind disconnects
As flowers, we grace the earth with our presence
The tide rises and turns
And we simply expire

Over-saturated
Our lungs fill with the essence of the universe
Until we feel the gentle kiss of dawn draw the water from our lungs
And we can breathe easy
Like night and day

We have never met aching for one another
We aim for congregation
You are my prey
You are the martyr
The blight takes its toll and our bodies grow black
Wilted, we fade away rotted from the root
We exchange our stem for legs
We blossom into our bodies
And the process has been reset

Welcome to your new home As far back as I can remember
The failure was always there
It was the only real companion that I have ever had
Not meant to live like this

Consciousness is nothing more than a vicious cycle
And I am being bled dry by my conviction
I've spent my life trying to find my confidence
And found absolutely nothing

Life is a lost cause
Too weak to carry on
I wish I'd never met who I once was
Not meant to live like this

Pursuing the love in all that I have lost
But I have left myself neglected
Deserted from the start
Longing for a chance to wander
A chance to chase my aspiration

When you're devoid of feeling
You just do as you're told
Hatred is exhausting
But it's all I'll ever know Tragedy is all we have in common
And at times we allow it to swallow us whole
Drawing the marrow from our misfortunes
To ignite the fire that's inside
Inhale the smoke from the burn that leaves you breathless
Breathing life into the lifeless
Dragging them into the sun and exposing them as apparitions

But is there dignity in living as an entity?
"You could have made history and we are already forgetting about you"
Humanity is poison
And we are lost without a cure
So stop your heart and start the healing process

I am not fit to walk among you
But I don't want to end my life
And just know that if I knew of any common ground
I'd leave here now
And I would find a home that I could die in
Just to say I tried to rest in peace

Erase me from your memory
The ones we love will let us down
And the rats will feed off of our failure
Eventually, this is something we must accept

The world moves on without us
We leave only footprints that fade away in time
Walk with fire and save yourself from vagrancy
We leave our spirits to retrace our steps

You are your memorial
Find your mark and make it
The soil is the last thing we ingest
We watch our ashes scatter
You are your own memorial
Find your mark and make it I am more than familiar with feeling empty
The conduit, I allow myself to drain
My mind is the trench in which I will be buried
Watch me wither away

Put me out of my misery
I can only find solace in sleep
A sub-conscious sanctuary
I am longing to be set free
Yet I am the one who holds the key
I am the one who holds the key

A lifetime spent trying to place the blame
On anyone or anything
This is not who I am
I am not who I used to be
Set me free I will graciously accept that my life’s work, whether it be in the past, the present, or the future
It will be overshadowed by those around me
With a different definition of “success”
Though I can’t explain the path I’ve chosen
All I know is I’m right where I need to be
And though I’ve turned down a chance at fame and fortune
I know that there is no greater payment than this

And I’m so fucking far from the life I’m supposed to lead, and the man I’m supposed to be and I couldn’t be happier
And I will remain a constant, I know where I stand, and I refuse to let their selfishness take control of who I am
Take control of who I am
Take control of who I am

And while I may die poor, at least my life had meaning
There’s more to life than living, and I truly feel alive
And I know that when I die
There will be others who feel the same way ready to take my place

This is our song of protest
I promise you that nothing is slowing us down
I promise you
That nothing is slowing us down

And while I may die poor, at least my life had meaning
There’s more to life than living and I truly feel alive
And I know that when I die
There will be others who feel the same way ready to take my place
And I will laugh in the face of those who tell me different
And I will laugh in the face of those who tell me different

Even with both of my feet planted firmly on the ground
I am free to move in my own direction
I will remain a constant
I know where I stand
I know where I stand
I know where I stand
I know where I stand
I know where I stand 
I've saved a drop of blood for when I truly need it most
To be distributed among the parasites
I've saved a drop of blood for when I truly need it most
To be exchanged for a purer form of pain


My ribcage will replace a ladder's rungs
Leading me towards the ceiling of my curse
As the earth falls upward from the ground
Where I collapse in sunken skies


I am but one man
And the sorrow I have salvaged won't sustain


Murder me in the silence I have lived in
My fingernails won't hold a torch that mirrors my reflection
Murder me in the silence I have lived in


No trace of tension could coerce the composition from my skull
Like a currency reserved for skeletons
I will deny a high regard
Sick to my stomach at the distance to the ground


My ribcage will replace a ladder's rungs
Leading you towards the depth of my despair
We collapse inside the walls that close before us


Murder me in the silence I have lived in
A fabrication to appease the ones who suffer


Don't call me your protector
I couldn't keep myself from caving in
Don't call me your protector
A war against myself I'll never win


I've saved a drop of blood for when I truly need it most
To be distributed among the parasites
I've saved a drop of blood for when I truly need it most
To be exchanged for a purer form of pain The most common insecurity is our destination after our conscious fades away
The biggest factor in how one molds their existence
Is nothing more than a distraction from what is really important;
Who we are in the present
I know in my heart the life I lead now means more to this world
Than any "reward" I may receive after death
I know this to be the truth
I refuse to sacrifice the life
That I've been given in the hopes of something greater
When all I need is right in front of me
Because I believe in man, I believe in myself, and nothing else

I can't put my faith in uncertainty
While there's still no proof of validity amongst the old familiar pages
Which to me are nothing more than fucking words
I will choose life over faith, and I will put my trust back in myself
And then I'll be free
Together we can eliminate the worry and the fear
From the minds and hearts of our fellow man
I know in my heart who I need to be We ache to be transparent
We run from the "open" arms;
The facade of something greater than ourselves
And we're left to coexist with infestation

Our history is cursed
Through the past, present, and future
If we're created in his image
Then his image is disgusting...
And even he can't wipe you clean

How can someone see so far ahead
While they're spending every day on their knees?
Is the view from above really worth all of the judgement passed?
The fear, the lies, and the manipulation?
A doctrine bathed in ignorance
And written in the blood of the enslaved

And I have never lost my faith
I just never had any to begin with
I would sooner die for my sins
Than pray for my forgiveness
Sew my palms together
And crucify the thoughts in my mind

Awaiting Armageddon
Neglecting to exorcise the demons in your head
You're "born again"
But you're better off dead
Conversion or a casualty
Renounce and save yourself

Is the view from Heaven really worth all of the judgement passed?
The pestilence that you've inflicted
And the souls of all the loved ones that we've lost?
We are the sheep that rose against the shepherd
We are the ones you led astray
Embrace the light in your heart
Not the one in the sky

Saints and sinners rejoice
We will all rot together 
Drifting through decaying arteries
Repurposing the shell that I have severed to withstand paralysis
Straining as my eyes lose the ability to see
Displaced by my disease pursuing darkness
Instinct will carry me across a fragile plain
To burn in the deficiency of sun
Scatter my remains as the flesh withers away


Remember me for all I failed to be
When my misery comes to an end
Deliver me to a place I'll never leave
I wish I could feel safer in my skin


Chiseling my name into the clouds
To alleviate the burden of the dead
That wander without direction
Depart from the existence I've denounced
Embedded in the souls that I once lead


Sewing strings of separation in the centre of a storm


I wish I could feel safer in my skin
I wish I could feel safer in my skin


Remember me for all I failed to be
When my misery comes to an end
Deliver me to a place I'll never leave
I wish I could feel safer in my skin If I allow the light to leave my eyes
Then I will never see again
The thoughts disintegrate into cognitive pollution
Abandoning my body, renouncing my existence
Show me the meaning of happiness

Trapped inside this nightmare
But I haven't slept for days
I am a slave
A slave to what I cannot see
Are we being strung along or have I just strung out?

The quest to be clairvoyant:
You are your own black hole
But how much longer do I really have
When I wish every breath would be my last?

Your words like rope
Tied around my throat
Remove the earth beneath me
Watch my spirit sink Our city lies in ruins
And our livelihood is next
Left to build from decay
With the whole world crashing down around you
How the fuck could we let this happen?
And no answers come to mind
We're caught in a steady decline
And there's no deterrent
The aftermath could bring you to your knees
Guilt is starting to dissolve you from the inside out
And you're grasping at your last chance for salvation
And it's on its way

This is our own world
And its up to us to decide our own fate
And even though change may be unavoidable
It's up to us to emerge
From the bottom of the barrel
As a whole, we can impact mankind for the better
And the earlier we realize this
The sooner we can reassemble our lives
Now is our chance to rebuild Why do I need to justify my opinion, after all that I’ve seen and done?
And year after year, we give our everything to get nothing in return
The time has come for things to change
We don’t need your adoration, but we demand your respect
I will not allow anyone the opportunity to deny half a decade of labor

The places we’ve been, the faces we’ve seen, the months spent far from home
This is what moves us
This is what we’ve grown accustom to
What we will leave behind can not be measured in a dollar figure. There’s a much deeper meaning than that
I can’t wait until the day when we’ve surpassed everything that gave you a false sense of importance

I want you to question yourself
I want you to watch you slip away
I want you to realize that your existence has meant nothing
I hate you more than you could ever fucking know
And I hate you for making me feel like this

I know deep down that I’m a good person, but my patience is wearing thin
The best retaliation I can think of, would be to let you know that for once in my life, I am truly happy
I’m more than content with who and where I am
Your oppression has had no effect
I don’t need to justify my opinion after all that we’ve been through
And year after year, we give our everything and what we receive in return, I can’t explain with words
I’m so fucking thankful that I made it to where I am today
(I watched the world upon your shoulders, and from these heights it’s so far down) As time passes by, I feel everything changing but me
I will not feel the sting of defeat
I’ve watched days become months, become years
And I’ve lost all faith in progression
I will never allow myself to exchange all my morals for acceptance If this is truly where I belong, I’ll fucking be here until the end of time

I’ve watched everyone around me jump ship
And I hope they’re left to sink
The current will carry us

I am proud of all that I’ve become
And I’m well aware that I have steered myself in the right direction Your life is yours to decide
I just can’t respect your decision
I would rather isolate myself than be a walking definition of travesty
I watched you do away with everything
I would love nothing more than to watch this world swallow you whole
You were the catalyst for your downfall

But where the rest have failed, we are bound to succeed
And mark my fucking words, as long as we are breathing
We will overcome
We will overcome
The integrity we emanate day to day is unparalleled
And our efforts will not go unnoticed

We will be remembered
We will be remembered
We will be remembered
We will be remembered
We will be remembered
We will be remembered Our once-solid path is starting to diverge
And the space between us growing ever greater
Makes it hard for me to breathe
But no amount of distance can change my feelings for you

How can it be that a day I've always dreamed of
Could also be a day that I wished would never come?
And we are slowly becoming two very different people
But I won't give you up without a fight
This is everything I've ever meant to say to you
You could be thousands of miles away
But I'll still see you when I close my eyes

We've come too far to let our story end like this
And we've come too far to let what we've built fall apart
We both know this is love
I will never forget you I want to thank you for never being there
Your absence has forced me to find my own way
While others are led through life with a blindfold, I can see clearly the rain will wash me away

I reject the thought of a god
When all we see is the work of an ill-fated world
I reject a liar’s cross

Who am I to say what I believe is right for the masses?
I just know it’s right for me
For this I have secured my place in hell
But every day I face is my own heaven in the making What do you believe in? What do you think is right?

Centuries have passed, the voice of reason is still being suppressed
Salvation dances in front of their faces
But they’re too blind to see

I reject the thought of a god
When all we see is the work of an ill-fated world
I reject a liar’s cross

Thank God for never being there
Thank God for never being there
Thank God for never being there
Thank God for never being there This is the only thing I have worth holding onto
I have condensed my past to fit the lines on the pages
That no one will ever see
But still I fight, day after day
‘Cause this is all I’ve ever wanted my life to be and I push everything I’ve ever loved away to keep myself from sinking
To keep myself from sinking
To keep myself from sinking

If I find the bad in everything, I can never be attached
I’m trying to find a balance
I'm trying to find a way
And every choice I’ve ever made
Brings me anywhere but home
But I’ve welcomed sacrifice with open arms
And I will never regret my decision
This is the only thing that makes me feel alive
Makes me feel alive

I’ve simply been searching for the right place to rest my head
I’m searching for common ground between all that I am
And all that you need me to be
I’ve seen a future and want nothing to do with it
A constant campaign to impress those who never ever cared
I’m struggling but I won’t allow myself to sink

You know where to find me
I keep my composure and assume my place
In front of the people I love most
You’re the reason why we’re here
I’m struggling
But I won’t allow myself to sink
I’m struggling
But I won’t allow myself to sink When you're reduced to living everyday
Carrying the weight of your conscience on your back
Just know it can be lifted
And you can be victorious
In this war against yourself

You've got the strength inside
To turn this all around
And I can only speak from experience
The rest is up to you

Whether you're stuck in the past
Or lost in the future
This is for you
I'm standing my ground
Living for right now
And I'm finally free
Only anchors can keep me from moving forward Others may tell you how to live
But I can assure you that your life
Is in your own hands
And you can mold it into any shape you want
Though you must have faith
While you're searching for the answers
That we're all longing for
And we are left to salvage for our aspirations
Be what you want to be
And leave the rest behind you

Anyone can follow blindly
But it's up to you to rise above the masses
And chase your dreams
Because in the end
They will become reality

You cannot lead us from our path
As we are weighed down by our ambitions
And all the force in the world
Cannot make us falter

We are all prophets in the making
And our legacies are beginning to unfold
I will not go to my grave
Yearning for what could have been
I know exactly who I am
And I know exactly what I will become I never asked for anyone to listen
And I never asked for anyone to take my words to heart
I’ve let myself become a target based on nothing more than expression
I will not lie to others, and I won’t lie to myself
If you’re searching for safety you can find it somewhere else
And I won’t mind

I’ve never seen myself as optimistic
So this should come as no surprise
No one feels good forever
Not even me
But this doesn’t give us an excuse to become useless like the rest
We will turn our hatred into something to be proud of
We will make life worth living Though I look forward to my future, just know I’m scared to death
After all is said and done, I won’t have a clue what to do next
Will I struggle to find the answer?
Will I take an easy way out?
Or will I find the strength inside to carry on?

My greatest fear is amounting to nothing
I hate the fact that I feel no sense of security
But more importantly, I hate the fact that I can’t confide in myself
It feels like nothing good will stay, unless I stay the same
I need to find a way to dissolve the uncertainty
This is who I am, and this is who I’ll always be

I refuse to be afraid of something I don’t know to be true
Something I don’t know to be true
I need to pick myself back up
I need to find a way to keep all the worry from head
Before it sends me to an early grave

I refuse
I refuse to let fear define me
I refuse
I refuse to let fear define me
I refuse
I refuse to let fear define me
I refuse to let fear define me
I refuse to let fear define me
I refuse
I refuse I’m looking back on those I once looked up to
And I can’t help but feel that I’m looking down
Everyone I’ve ever admired has left me with nothing
Not even a memory

I remember growing up, and yearning to be just like you
It pains me to admit that I held you in such a high regard
As if my life would mean nothing without your approval
But now I see the error of my ways
All that time spent searching for myself in someone else
I think it’s safe to say that I’ve become everything I wanted to be
And no one can take that from me

All of my heroes have failed me, but I won’t fail myself
I can’t believe how naive I used to be when I never really needed anyone
All my heroes have failed me, but I won’t ever fail myself
All my heroes have failed me, but I won’t ever fail myself

All my heroes have failed me
All my heroes have failed me Everything we are today
Stems from the marrow of our back bone
This is dedication at its finest
And I owe everything that I have to you
Our driving force
Causing us to constantly better ourselves
We are redefining the meaning of contentment
And though the odds are against us
We all know that we will prevail
We will prevail

Accepting all the negativity and turning it into fuel
For the flames that we keep burning on the inside
Burning from the inside-out

Consider this a thank you
For helping us to mold our future selves
And your words alone are not enough to destroy our commitment

This is where I belong
This where we belong

This is where I belong
This where we belong

This is where I belong
This where we belong

This is where I belong
This where we belong

This is where I belong
This where we belong

This is where I belong
This where we belong

This is where I belong
This where we belong

This is where I belong
This where- The best news I've ever heard
Was when you said you wouldn't leave
Because I knew the distance would tear us apart
And all the things you said
Wouldn't mean a thing if you weren't here with me
So as you turn your back to me
I just want to let you know
That I could never do this to you

This is where our roads divide, and they split in two
And I will never see you again
But I respect your choice

The familiar pain sets in again
And I won't let this drag me down
It's things like this that made me who I am today
It's thing like this that helped to shape, make me who I am today
It's every hardship that I've faced

And I've lost hope in myself
But I just want you to know:
As every day goes by
I must accept that you're now living your own life We are now rooted in the ground
That we were born into
And this is where we come from
Where we will remain
This place may have its flaws
But I can always call the pavement
We now stand upon "my home"

This is our home

Through the areas of wealth and poverty
I appreciate every inch of our city
And I don't know if I could ever leave
Our sanctuary
Our stomping ground
Our territory
Our fucking home
Love where you come from
This is your home
This is my home We are quickly being led to an early grave
By the ones that were meant to nourish our growth
And though their influence is the tallest barrier
That we are left to face

We can overcome this
It's us against this fucking world
But we are armed with hope and heart
And we're unbreakable
This is an uprising
And we will be the ones left standing

And if you answer this calling
I promise you that we will remain true to ourselves
And we can put this all behind us
Confide in us, and we'll confide in you
And together we are unstoppable
We're taking back what belongs to us
We need to find a different way
A way to stay true to who we are
And a way to overcome this Facing every morning sun
With a sense of resentment
And a lack of admiration
For everything and everyone
That I've come in contact with
I can't hold back the truth
When this has become the extent of my existence
I witnessed a change with my own eyes
I did nothing to stop this To quote from Whitman:
"O me! O life!
Of the questions of these recurring
Of the endless trains of the faithless
Of cities fill'd with the foolish
What good amid these, O me, O life?
Answer
That you are here
That life exists, and identity
That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse."

What will your verse be? Will you love me when there's nothing left to love? (x4)

There's nothing left to love (x4) Struggling to remain rooted in the depths of positivity
While modern day eats away at the foundation around me
And nothing that I do or say seems to rid me of this cynicism
This isn't how I hoped I'd ever feel, and I will not allow myself
To become the advocate for everything that I stand against
And I will not be consumed by pessimism
I will choose to live, rather than "exist"
And while the weight of the world pins me down
I know that humanity is something worth fighting for

Even though we must acknowledge our flaws and those of the world around us
We cannot allow them to control what's ours
We control our own destiny, from this day and to the grave

I will not turn my back on the problems I will face
I will embrace and overcome, and use them to create a better future
Living day to day is a gift I refuse to squander away
We control our own destiny The sense of insignificance
It winds itself around your chest
Surrender and submission have now become
What it takes to be alive

Just keep in mind
This happens to the best of us at times
And it's not going to get any easier
You walk this road of desolation
Only to end up on your knees
But just know that you are not alone

The only things holding you back
Are the lies that you refuse to challenge
You're drowning in a sea of self destruction
And your lungs are starting to cave in
And when you feel that your words
Can only be heard in echoes
They are more deafening than ever before

Every day we face helps build the strength
That makes us who we are
I've lived through this
And so can you
Suffering in silence has become
Something thrown to our past
And though the friendships that we've built
Are constantly falling apart

The remaining few retain the most heart
And I'll give you my heart
